Feeling a little overwhelmed here with adding in the boxes for people to type in items, as well as getting the first line of the table to render in the right position. I may have to just make that first cell empty so it'll fill the rest of the table in the right way. This really is the toughest week, at least so far. I have not taken this class before so I wouldn't know. Hopefully I will be able to figure it out eventually with help.
