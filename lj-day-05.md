# learning-journal - Day 005

It's Friday of the first week of the course and I feel fairly confident in my ability to at least, fill in an existing template for html, js, and css.
I'm not too sure where I stand with my fellow peers, but I have had the opportunity to work with a few of them; Adan, Spencer, and Mat.
They have helped me a great deal to stay caught up with the class during demos as well as the TA's during lab time.
I am still unclear about starting code from scratch but, I am getting pretty good at remembering how to use github and the terminal on the fly.
At least that much is becoming automatic.
