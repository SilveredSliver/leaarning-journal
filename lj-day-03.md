 Day 002 - This class so far is pretty neat! I have been a little confused with using the terminal so far and haven't remembered much of anything concerning the commands and various inputs I need to get to where I need to be yet, but I'm hoping I will be able to learn more of it as time goes on.

Day 003 - This class, we learned to create new branches and make pull requests between branches on github in order to move changes from one branch to another.
We also learned how to write for loops, make arrays, and count number of correct answers made my user inputs to prompt questions from code that we wrote.
Overall, this was overwhelming to say the least. I had to get a bunch of help because I wrote a couple lines of code that were true, so the repl.it didn't complain about syntax, but the rest of my code wouldn't run after those lines.
I also am very unfamiliar with where to put certain lines of new code in order to fulfill the new requirements of the assignment today.
I hope that with repetition, I will be able to convert this to memory.
