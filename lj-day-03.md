 Day 002 - This class so far is pretty neat! I have been a little confused with using the terminal so far and haven't remembered much of anything concerning the commands and various inputs I need to get to where I need to be yet, but I'm hoping I will be able to learn more of it as time goes on.

Day 003 - This class, we learned to create new branches and make pull requests between branches on github in order to move changes from one branch to another.
