It's Friday so I can take some time to catch up, especially on those readings. I still feel a little lost with remembering exactly what order things go in, but it really comes down to learning to interpret the content of existing code and then remembering what goes with what, like how every javascript object has a prototype, which is also an object and how all javascript objects inherit their methods and properties from their specific prototype.
Try saying that 5 times fast...
